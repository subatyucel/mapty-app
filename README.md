# Mapty App

This project is a practice exercise based on lessons from [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) course.

## Overview

Mapty is a web application that allows users to log their workouts on a map. Users can input details about their running or cycling workouts, and the app will display the workouts on a map using geolocation.
